#  Identify relevant galaxy properties

Summary -- Create a document containing the requirements for DC2 and DC3 with regard to prediction tools. The
document will include: the list of statistics for which predictions are needed, the required accuracy of the
predictions, a specification of the valid range of cosmology model space and scales, and the systematic
effects that should be included. As an example, it is already known that the clusters WG will need mass
function prediction to better than 5%.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS6.2.1 ( 12/16 ): Generate document that lists all requirements for DC2/DC3.
* Key Task CS6.2.2 ( 12/16 ): Develop strategy to deliver prediction tools if they go beyond what is already available.

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
